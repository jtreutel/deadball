HOW TO USE:

1. Fire up "mlbToDeadballConverter.py"
2. Enter desired year and team name
3. Select players from roster and write them down on your roster sheet


NOTES:
1. This converter works with raw data. You'll need to sanity check it yourself (a player with two PAs can have an OBP of .500, for example)
2. The farther back you go, the less reliable the data is, and the more you will need to check it
